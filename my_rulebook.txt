**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The USER command is used to identify the user to the server in the FTP protocol. It is typically the first command sent after establishing the control connection and can be used at any time to change access control information, which resets the authentication process. The USER command is part of the login process and is followed by the PASS command to complete the authentication. Executing the USER command does not influence the system state, and it can be used anytime during the FTP session to reset user authentication.

chapter 1:
**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The PORT command is used to specify an alternate data port for data transfer, typically when the default port needs to be changed. It is part of the transfer parameters and is usually followed by a service command such as RETR or STOR. Executing the PORT command does not change the system state, and it can be used anytime. However, the server is responsible for closing the data connection after the transfer is complete, unless the connection is to remain open for subsequent transfers in Block or Compressed mode.

---


chapter 2:
**Chapter 2: Valid Direct Preceding Commands/Methods**

The following commands can directly precede the PORT command:

Executing NLST initiates the directory listing transfer in a concise format, changing the system state to transfer the directory listing. The server closes the connection after the transfer unless in Block or Compressed mode.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The PASV command is used to request the server to listen on a non-default data port for incoming data connections, allowing the server to wait for a connection rather than initiating one. Executing PASV does not change the system state, and it can be used at any time, typically before initiating a data transfer command such as RETR, STOR, LIST, or NLST.



**Chapter 2: Valid Direct Preceding Commands/Methods**

- **PORT**: The system must be in a state where a data connection is being negotiated. Executing PASV after PORT allows the server to identify a non-default server-side data port without changing the system state.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The TYPE command is used to specify the representation type and format for data transfer, such as ASCII, EBCDIC, or TYPE L 36 for paged files. The default value for TYPE is ASCII Non-print. Executing the TYPE command does not influence the system state, and it can be used at any time. It is part of the minimum implementation required for FTP servers.

---


**Chapter 2: Valid Direct Preceding Commands/Methods**

- **MODE**: The system must be in the default state. Executing MODE before TYPE sets the transfer mode to Stream. The system state remains in the default state.

- **STOR**: The system must be in the default state. Executing STOR after TYPE does not change the system state, and it remains in the default state.
- **NOOP**: The system must be in the default state. Executing NOOP after TYPE does not change the system state, and it remains in the default state.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

The STRU command is used to set the file structure, enabling the file to have an internal structure beyond the default continuous data byte sequence. It is part of the transfer parameters group and receives a 200 reply upon success. The STRU command is specifically used to handle paged files, such as those in TOPS-20 systems, by setting the structure to page-oriented (STRU P). This is particularly useful for efficiently transmitting files with page structures, including those with "holey" files where not all pages are contiguous. Executing STRU does not change the system state, and it can be used anytime to set this structure.

chapter 1:
**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The RETR command is used to retrieve a file from the server, and it does not alter the system state beyond the data transfer. The file's status and contents at the server site remain unaffected. It can be executed at any time, particularly after a restart procedure.

---


chapter 2:
**Chapter 2: Valid Direct Preceding Commands/Methods**

- **Restart Command (REST):**
  - **State Required:** The system must be in a state where a file transfer was interrupted, and a restart is needed.
  - **Effect of RETR:** Executing RETR after the REST command resumes the file transfer from the specified checkpoint. The system state transitions to the data transfer state, but the server's file status and contents remain unchanged.

- **PORT Command:**
  - **State Required:** The system must be in a state where the PORT command has been issued, specifying the data port for the transfer.
  - **Effect of RETR:** Executing RETR after the PORT command initiates the file retrieval from the server. The system state transitions to the data transfer state, and the server begins sending the requested file to the specified port.

- **USER Command:**
  - **State Required:** The system must be in a state where the USER command has been successfully authenticated.
  - **Effect of RETR:** Executing RETR after the USER command allows the authenticated user to retrieve a file. The system state transitions to the data transfer state.

- **PASS Command:**
  - **State Required:** The system must be in a state where the PASS command has been accepted, completing the user authentication.
  - **Effect of RETR:** Executing RETR after the PASS command enables the authenticated user to retrieve a file. The system state transitions to the data transfer state.

chapter 3:
**Chapter 3: Valid Direct Subsequent Commands/Methods**

- **TYPE Command:**
  - **State Required:** The system must be in a state where the RETR command has completed the file transfer.
  - **Effect of TYPE:** Executing TYPE after RETR changes the data transfer type for subsequent commands. The system state updates to the new transfer type.

- **QUIT Command:**
  - **State Required:** The system must be in a state where the RETR command has completed the file transfer.
  - **Effect of QUIT:** Executing QUIT after RETR terminates the FTP session and closes all connections. The system state transitions to a disconnected state.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

The STOR command is used to upload a file from the client to the server. It is particularly useful for handling paged files, such as those in TOPS-20 systems, where each page is a contiguous set of 512 words of 36 bits each. The command supports efficient transmission of files with structures like page tables and attributes. Executing STOR changes the system state by adding a new file to the server or replacing the contents of an existing file if it already exists. It can be used anytime as long as the user is authenticated and in the correct mode, and it requires specific transfer parameters (TYPE L 36, STRU P, and MODE S) for paged files.


- USER command: The system must be in a state where user authentication is required. Executing STOR after the USER command changes the system state to an authenticated state ready for file transfer.


- QUIT command: The system must be in a state where the file transfer has been attempted but resulted in an error. Executing QUIT after STOR changes the system state to closing all connections.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The STOU (Store Unique) command is used to store a file uniquely on the server, ensuring no duplicate files are created. Executing STOU influences the system state by writing a new file to the server and must be followed by a 250 Transfer Started response, which includes the name generated for the unique file. It can be used anytime after establishing a connection and logging in, typically following commands that set up the transfer parameters. STOU does not transition the system to data transfer mode but requires a 250 response to confirm the file's unique storage.


**Chapter 2: Valid Direct Preceding Commands/Methods**

- **TYPE**: Must be in a state ready for data transfer. STOU transitions to data transfer mode.
- **MODE**: Must be in a state ready for data transfer. STOU transitions to data transfer mode.


**Chapter 3: Valid Direct Subsequent Commands/Methods**

- **RETR**: System is in data transfer mode. RETR retrieves a file, changing state to file transfer.
- **STOR**: System is in data transfer mode. STOR stores a file, changing state to file transfer.

- **QUIT**: System is in command mode. QUIT ends the session, changing state to disconnected.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

The APPE (APPEND) command is used to append data to an existing file at the server site or create a new file if it does not exist. Executing the APPE command changes the system state by modifying the file. It can be used anytime, provided the server is in the correct state to accept the command and after handling any expected 100 series replies.


- **REST**: The REST command can directly precede APPE. The system must be in a state where a file transfer needs to be restarted. Executing APPE after REST changes the system state by resuming the file transfer and appending data to the specified file.


There are no explicitly defined commands that must directly follow the APPE command in the provided context. The APPE command can be followed by any valid FTP command, depending on the desired subsequent action.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The ALLO command is used to allocate storage for a file to be transferred, reserving sufficient space on the server. Executing ALLO may change the system state by reserving storage, though this effect depends on the server's implementation. Some servers may treat ALLO as a no-operation (NOOP) if they do not require prior allocation. ALLO can be used anytime before initiating a file transfer, typically followed by STOR, APPE, or RETR commands.



**Chapter 2: Valid Direct Preceding Commands/Methods**

The ALLO command does not have specific required preceding commands beyond setting up transfer parameters. It is typically part of a sequence that includes commands like TYPE, MODE, or STRUCT, but these are not explicitly required by the context. Therefore, there are no specific commands that must directly precede ALLO.



**Chapter 3: Valid Direct Subsequent Commands/Methods**

- **STOR (STORE):** The system must be ready to receive data. Executing STOR after ALLO starts the file transfer and creates or overwrites the file on the server, changing the system state by storing the file.
- **APPE (APPEND):** The system must be ready to receive data. Executing APPE after ALLO appends data to an existing file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist, changing the system state by modifying the file.
- **RETR (RETRIEVE):** The system must be ready to send data. Executing RETR after ALLO retrieves a file from the server, changing the system state by sending the file to the client. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------

**Chapter 1: Command Purpose & Outlines**

The REST (RESTART) command is used to restart a file transfer from a specified checkpoint. It does not initiate the file transfer itself but sets a marker to resume from a previously specified point. Executing REST does not change the system state; it merely sets the restart marker. This command can be used anytime during a file transfer to resume from a previously set marker. The REST command may receive a 350 reply indicating it has been accepted, or error codes such as 500, 501, 502, 421, or 530 if it fails.
